# instagram_fake_detection_model
üîç Project Overview:
Fake engagement in OSNs, characterized by the artificial enhancement of an account's popularity, poses several significant problems:

Financial losses for businesses
Ineffective audience targeting in advertising campaigns
Misleading product recommendation systems
Degradation of the social network environment
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to detect fake accounts and engagements, ensuring the integrity and reliability of social¬†media¬†metrics.
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras
Techniques Implemented: Data preprocessing, data visualization, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics
üìà Key Learnings and Results:

Data Quality: Comprehensive data understanding and preparation are fundamental for building accurate and reliable models.
Algorithm Evaluation:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Out of these, the Random Forest algorithm provided the highest accuracy at 96%. Additionally, I explored a neural network approach which achieved an impressive accuracy of 95%.
Performance Metrics: Utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score was essential for evaluating model performance.
Handling Imbalance: Addressing imbalanced datasets with techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was crucial for improving model¬†effectiveness.
